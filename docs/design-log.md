# Design Log & Reconciliation Notes

A **running** document. The dev-doc (`dev-doc.md`) is the clean spec — phases,
invariants, acceptance tests. This file is everything *around* it: decisions
taken in conversation, reconciliations between competing framings, deliberate
deviations from the spec, and open questions. `scaling.md` owns the
distribution / web-scale story; this file points there rather than duplicating.

**How to use:** append dated entries; do not rewrite history. When a decision
here graduates into the spec, note it and leave the log entry as the rationale.
Cross-link with `[dev-doc §X]`, `[scaling.md §Y]`.

## 1. The reconciliation: two formalisms → one bare substrate

**The problem.** The dev-doc and reference experiments carry two different
substrates that were never explicitly bridged:

| | Holonomy substrate (P0/P1/P2/P3) | Counting substrate (P1b, `0e`–`0i`) |
|---|---|---|
| state | edges carry **Z**; BFS potential | **union-find** over collections |
| signal | nonzero loop **holonomy** = defect | "class ONEMORE of itself" |
| machinery | `holonomy.py` | bare `UF` + `derive()` |

The experiments `0e/0h/0i` re-implement their own mini-webs and never touch
`web.py`/`holonomy.py`, yet the repo layout routes everything through them and
invariant 9 defines the signal as defect *mass over loops* (a holonomy notion
the counting side never computes). Left unreconciled, the project is a pile of
demos and the "one algebra / one bus" thesis stays rhetorical.

**The resolution (decided 2026-07-09).** *"Bare web is the standard."* The
canonical atom is the bare `(collection₁, collection₂, pairing)` episode — no
numbers, no relation labels. Everything else is a **derived projection** on top:

- `ONEMORE(A,B)` → a `+1` edge between class nodes.
- `MATCH(A,B)` → a **merge** (node identification); the union-find quotient of
  the experiments *is* the merge-commitment projection.
- successor **injectivity** ("a class with two successors must merge them") →
  a merge of two nodes the holonomy says sit at **equal potential** — i.e. a
  0-holonomy *compression*, a sleep-phase quotient, not a defect repair. This
  is exactly how `0e.repair()` frames it.
- **"class ONEMORE of itself"** → a `+1` **self-loop** → holonomy `+1 ≠ 0` → a
  genuine defect. This is what makes **invariant 9 literally true** for the
  counting contradictions.
- subtraction-probe growth (the negative numbers) → `grow` at the quotient
  level → literally P1.

So the labeled, Z-valued web is not a parallel system; it is what the learner
*derives* from bare episodes. `holonomy.py` is the one defect engine; the
union-find in `0e`–`0i` is a fast special-case of the merge projection.

**Consequences for the build.**
- The bare `Episode` is the substrate atom (`episode.py`), already built in P0.
- P1b's job is the **derivation layer**: bare episodes → MATCH/ONEMORE →
  merge / `+1`-edge commitments, with the self-loop surfaced as a holonomy
  defect. `0e`–`0i` get refactored to route through `web.py` rather than
  standing alone.
- Downstream phases (P2, P3) consume the **derived class chain**, not synthetic
  number nodes [dev-doc P1b].

**Still open (see §5):** whether MATCH is best modelled as a node merge or as a
`0`-value "same" edge (I lean merge — it makes injectivity and retraction fall
out cleanly); and exactly how `loop_closes` / `distinct` observations are
themselves *derived* from bare episodes rather than asserted.

---

## 2. Decisions taken in conversation (2026-07-09)

Recorded with rationale so we don't relitigate.

1. **Re-found P0 on the event-sourced substrate now**, rather than building P1
   on the in-place P0 and retrofitting. Rationale: invariants 4–8 are
   foundational; if the log/bus/projection/fork don't exist from the start, the
   later phases stop being "seams" (inv 8's own claim) and become rewrites.
   *Done — commit `7944776`.*

2. **"Bare web is the standard"** — see §1.

3. **Retraction locality is built in early.** Provenance links are first-class
   (`commit → episode ids`); episode ids are opaque `(source, seq)` handles, not
   list positions, so compaction and multi-source merge never break provenance.
   Whole-log rebuild for now; causal-cone scoping deferred [scaling.md §3].

4. **Not a local monolith.** The system must be able to run across machines /
   over a network / with volunteer compute eventually. The monotone core (log,
   union-find, exclusion set) is CRDT-shaped, so distribution is a *join*, not a
   protocol. Nothing scheduled [scaling.md §4].

5. **"Every op emits" (inv 4) is a bootstrap property, not an eternal law.**
   At scale, *what* to emit and *when* to simulate become **learned** attention
   policies; emission may be aggregated; simulation is phase-gated by wake /
   sleep / dream cycles, not always-on. Keep emission behind a single seam
   (`Web._trace` / `Journal.emit`) so the future policy has one hook
   [scaling.md §6].

6. **Perception (text/media → episodes) is out of scope.** This project is the
   "after clean relational episodes" engine; the front-end sets the real
   accuracy ceiling at scale [scaling.md §7].

---

## 3. Deliberate deviations from the dev-doc

Where the implementation intentionally differs from the letter of the spec, and
why. (Candidate dev-doc edits are flagged in §4.)

- **Package layout.** Spec sketches a flat `relweb/`. We use an installable
  `src/relweblearner/` package (Poetry, in-project `.venv`). Requested: "keep
  src/, use better structure than the doc."
- **Defect extraction.** Spec says `nx.minimum_cycle_basis`. We use
  **spanning-tree fundamental cycles** (BFS potential → per-non-tree-edge
  residual). Reason: `minimum_cycle_basis` returns *unordered node sets*, which
  cannot be walked to compute a holonomy, and it is blind to parallel-edge
  bigons. Fundamental cycles are ordered, multigraph-safe, and give the same
  independent-class count. `nx.cycle_basis` (ordered) is kept as a cross-check
  in `cycle_basis_defects`.
- **Episode ids.** Opaque `(source, seq)` instead of positional indices — for
  compaction/merge-readiness [scaling.md §3–4].
- **`relabel` is ephemeral.** It mutates live edge values but is *not* a
  commitment (relabeling is meaningless bookkeeping, glossary), so a rebuild
  resets values. Holonomy is invariant either way.
- **Observation API is pre-derivation.** `observe_loop_closes` /
  `observe_distinct` are a low-level convenience like `add_edge`; P1b will
  derive these constraints from bare episodes. Kept for unit tests / scaffolding.
- **Loop-closure contradiction detection is best-effort under parallel/merged
  edges.** Node-path holonomy is only well-defined on a simple graph; under
  parallels a node path is ambiguous. Distinctness-under-merge is checked
  exactly (alias map). Robust cycle-basis loop-closure checking lands with the
  P1 growth/rewire search.
- **Whole-log rebuild** rather than incremental/cone-scoped projection — correct
  at laptop scale; optimized when a phase stresses memory (P7 floods).
- **P2 uses robust consensus, not `sympy` nullspace.** The spec suggests
  "sympy integer least squares / nullspace" for per-relation transport. Because
  the P1b chain already provides node coordinates, classification reduces to a
  per-relation transport-sample consensus under an exception budget — simpler,
  and it is what actually delivers e2's noise tolerance (a nullspace solve is
  brittle to a single bad row). `sympy` stays available for P4's partial-algebra
  work but is unused in P2. See §8.
- **P1b commits merges eagerly (single MATCH), not at k≥2 (inv 6).** Required
  for e1b(e) to exhibit a visible contradiction from one poison; k≥2 provisional
  commitment and localize-and-replay move to P7. Safe because the merge is
  event-sourced and retractable. See §5.
- **The number projection uses its own construction journal.** `project()`
  builds the number web with a fresh journal so replaying the world log N times
  does not pollute it with N copies of construction traces. The world log
  (`NumberLearner.journal`) stays the clean, replayable source of truth. A
  literal reading of inv 4 ("one bus") is bent here for projection hygiene; the
  world/reflection bus is still single.

---

## 4. Candidate dev-doc edits (not yet applied — spec owned by you)

Left for you since you're actively editing `dev-doc.md`:

- **P0 acceptance:** replace "extract independent defect classes via networkx
  `minimum_cycle_basis`" with fundamental-cycle residuals (+ `cycle_basis`
  cross-check). See §3.
- **P3 vs P1b tension:** P3 still describes synthetic entities `0..N`, but P1b
  mandates downstream phases consume the *constructed* class chain. Clarify that
  baselines get synthetic triples while the web learner gets constructed classes.
- **§4 Metrics is stale** vs the new phases: add collateral-retraction count,
  detection rate / time-to-detection, cf-vs-real act split, attention backlog,
  and the consistent-lie cost curve.
- **Invariant 4 wording:** note it is constitutive at bootstrap and becomes a
  learned/aggregated policy at scale (see §2.5, scaling.md §6), so the CI test
  ("every public method emits") is a current-phase property, not eternal.
- **Repo layout block** references `relweb/`; we use `src/relweblearner/`.

---

## 5. Open questions

Reconciliation / substrate:
- ~~**MATCH = merge, or MATCH = `0`-value "same" edge?**~~ **Resolved at P1b:
  MATCH = merge** (a rewire, with the poison's justifying episode as
  provenance). This makes the union-find quotient literally the merge
  projection, successor-injectivity a 0-holonomy compression, and — the payoff —
  "class ONEMORE of itself" a `+1` holonomy self-loop detected by
  `holonomy.defects` (invariant 9, no separate contradiction machinery). See §7.
- **How are `loop_closes` / `distinct` observations *derived* from bare
  episodes** rather than asserted? P1b derives MATCH/ONEMORE and never uses the
  pre-derivation Observation API, but the API still exists for P0/unit tests.
  Retire it once every phase consumes derived constraints.
- **Provisional commitment (inv 6, k≥2).** *Deferred to P7.* P1b commits merges
  **eagerly on a single MATCH** — required for e1b(e): one poisoned episode must
  produce a visible 'class ONEMORE of itself' defect, which a k≥2 gate would
  suppress. This is a deliberate deviation from inv 6 (see §3). The event-
  sourced substrate makes it safe: the poison is *retractable* by excluding its
  episode and re-projecting (shown in e1b(e)); P7 adds the k≥2 gate and the
  greedy localize-and-replay of `experiment0h`.

Carried from `scaling.md §9`:
- snapshot granularity; when a causal cone is safe to *seal* (compact);
  ensemble merge semantics across untrusted volunteers; whether aggregated
  emission preserves enough signal for P6 reflection to still form act-classes.

---

## 6. P1 growth engine — notes (2026-07-09)

- **Query walk is an act** (`Web.walk`, inv 4): stepping follows relation
  *structure*, not edge values, so a boundary walk-off is reachability, not
  gauge — which is why relabel is provably futile against it.
- **Persistence detector without corrupting state.** The "P rounds of
  relabel+rewire" run on **forks** (`Web.fork`, inv 8), never the committed web:
  relabel-futility is demonstrated on a throwaway fork, and each rewire
  candidate is scored on a fork (accept only if the whole walk completes in-web
  with no new defect). *Bug found & fixed:* an earlier version relabeled the
  real web, so `_step_value` read gauge-mangled values and accepted a bogus
  "bouncing" reconnection. Lesson logged: gauge moves must stay off the
  committed projection during search.
- **rewire-before-grow is real, not cosmetic.** If an existing node can
  complete the walk (e.g. a removed middle edge), a single rewire discharges it
  and growth is refused (`test_obstruction_completable_in_web_is_discharged_by_rewire`).
  Growth fires only for genuine boundary walk-offs.
- **Minimal growth** = exactly `deficit` fresh nodes chained with the frozen
  step value; "BFS over completion candidates" degenerates to this for a linear
  walk with no reusable node. Zero-shot arithmetic through the invented nodes is
  exact because the edges carry the same frozen `+1` (e1 (c): ≥20 facts).
- **Threshold, not drift** (e1 plot): growth is flat-zero for every in-web probe
  and turns on exactly at the first boundary crossing. `results/e1_growth.{csv,png}`.
- Open: the discharge accepts the *first* consistent in-web completion (bare —
  no notion of the "intended" node). Fine for e1; revisit if a phase needs the
  minimal/most-justified completion rather than any.

## 7. P1b number-from-counting — notes (2026-07-09)

The reconciliation of §1 is now code (`number.py`):

- **Bare episode → derived predicate → web move.** `derive(ep)` reads only
  `ep.leftovers()`: both empty → MATCH; one singleton leftover → ONEMORE. No
  numbers, no labels. MATCH → `web.rewire(merge=...)`; ONEMORE → `+1` succ edge.
- **The union-find quotient IS the web's merge projection.** `web.resolve`
  gives the class; classes are the numbers, appearing only in the merge log.
- **Contradiction = holonomy, not a special case.** A false MATCH welds two
  size-classes; a ONEMORE edge between them becomes a `+1` self-loop;
  `holonomy.defects` reports it as 'class ONEMORE of itself'. Invariant 9 is
  literally the counting-contradiction detector. (Confirmed: `defects()` handles
  self-loop edges — residual `phi[u]+1-phi[u] = 1`.)
- **Guarded successor-injectivity** merges the (unique) successor of each class
  but refuses to merge two classes with ONEMORE evidence between them — that
  would *create* the self-loop, i.e. hide the contradiction. So the poison stays
  visible; it is never "repaired" into a coherent-but-wrong chain.
- **Projection = replay (inv 5).** `project(exclude=...)` replays the world log
  minus an exclusion set, so retracting the poison is `exclude({pid})` +
  re-project — purity restored, no data deleted. This is the P7 hook, working.
- **Deviations logged in §3/§5:** eager single-witness merge (k≥2 → P7); the
  projection uses its own construction journal.
- e1b accepted (5 tests); `experiments/e1b_number.py` reproduces `0e` (staging,
  counting, poison) on the substrate. `results/e1b_number.{csv,png}`.

## 8. P2 symmetry-sector inference — notes (2026-07-09)

- **Coordinates come from P1b, so classification is per-relation transport
  consensus.** Each loop observation ``(a, b, r)`` contributes a sample
  ``coord(b) - coord(a)``; the winning transport is the one that minimizes
  exceptions (DL rule). A relation is homogeneous iff one transport explains
  ``≥ 1 - exception_fraction`` of samples.
  - ``g = 0`` → **symmetric** (the ``2g = 0`` signal: seen both ways, transport
    0 each way, consistent only with 0 over Z).
  - ``g ≠ 0`` → **antisymmetric**.
  - no constant fits → **non-homogeneous / motif** — ``double``'s transport is
    ``count(a)``, so support collapses (≈0.3–0.5, well under the 0.8 threshold).
- **Noise tolerance falls straight out of the exception budget.** One
  adversarial mislabel is a single exception, cheaper than abandoning the true
  transport, so the rule is unchanged (e2: 20/20, not just ≥18/20).
- **Consumes the constructed chain (dev-doc mandate).** `e2_sectors.py`
  end-to-end takes coordinates from a P1b `NumberChain` (class position), not
  given numbers; same/succ/double still classify correctly.
- Deviation logged in §3: robust consensus replaces the spec's sympy nullspace.
- e2 accepted (4 tests); `results/e2_sectors.{csv,png}`.

## 9. P2' unlabeled-relation type discovery — notes (2026-07-09)

- **The most "bare web is standard" phase.** Edges carry no labels; a relation
  type is a *structural equivalence class*. Two opposing operations, per the
  spec: **refinement** (`naive_degree_typing`, a 1-round WL degree-pair coloring
  that over-refines — 4 classes for 3 true types) and **compression** (the
  disjointness / mutual-exclusivity merge that recovers the truth).
- **Disjointness = Markman's mutual exclusivity.** Hubs whose member-sets are
  disjoint are the same type (colors are pairwise disjoint; plants are; a color
  and a plant *overlap* via shared fruits, so they stay distinct). Connected
  components of the disjointness graph are the attribute types; hub-free edges
  are the chain type.
- **Failure mode is a data-volume prediction, not a bug.** With too few crossing
  observations a color hub and a plant hub are accidentally disjoint → one
  bridging edge welds the two cliques → everything conflates into one type. The
  conflation-vs-coverage curve falls from 1.0 (no crossings) to ~0.13 (20
  crossings); generic/full coverage → 0. `results/e2p_types.{csv,png}`.
- **Runs on discovered types, not given ones** (dev-doc mandate): discovery
  consumes only unlabeled `(u, v)` pairs; `truth` is used solely for scoring.
- Kept as an unlabeled edge-list module (`types.py`) rather than forcing the
  bare-episode/Web wrapper — the discovery is purely structural over the graph;
  a `Web`'s `underlying_graph()` feeds it directly when needed.
- Accepted (4 tests); the naive-refinement over-refinement is logged for contrast.
